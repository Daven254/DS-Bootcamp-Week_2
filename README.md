# DS-Bootcamp-Week_2

Second week of code from Data Science Bootcamp by Data Society
Focus was on Statistics and Regression Modeling

## Modules

### Introductory Statistics
### Hypothesis Testing
### Intermediate Statistics
These Statistics modules included testing methods and their importance:

    - F-test
    - (Student) T-test
    - Chi-Squared Test of Normality
    - Chi-Squared Test of Goodness of Fit
    - Analysis of Histograms and other Graphical Techniques
    - Use of Statsmodels.api
    - QQPlots
    - Probability
    - Hypothesis Testing
  
### Simple Linear Regression
### Multivariable Linear Regression
### Nonlinear Regression
### Data Visualizations
These regression techniques relied on understanding of basic linear algebra and NumPy arrays. They were paired with data visualization techniques like scatterplots and lineplots for the purpose of analyzing the trends. Statsmodels.api was also imported in order to guage the statistical significance of the models and the data that they presented
